# cybersmart
This is a take home challenge for cybersmart - this application fetches cpu temperature using "system information" library and gets current weather/temp of a
location using api openweathermap 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Install application dependencies

### `yarn start`
To start the application and run on desktop


## Possible improvement 
1. Detect user location - instead of user typing it in
2. Poll for weather and cpu at certain interval and alert user with relevant info

## Add test
If i have more time, i will add unit test - from my research, recommended framework for test is spectron
